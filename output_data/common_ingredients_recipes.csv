back then, i'd just estimate the amount of yeast, salt, and sugar, and i'd toss in all sorts of extra ingredients.  once even a bread made with yellow cake mix and some leftover spinach.  

however, after moving to a mile-high altitude, i had to stop casually adding ingredients.  in fact, i couldn't even turn out a decent loaf of white bread.

i was about to donate my breadmaker away, when i came across tips for high-altitude baking on the internet.  i stayed up late one night reading.  then i started experimenting.  

my breadmaker is the welbilt model #abm-100.  [that's the breadmaker that's shaped like r2d2.]  

i played around with ingredient amounts until i found a combination that uses regular flour at high-altitude.  

now, i've never tried this at other high altitudes ... maybe what works in my altitude/temperature/humidity will fail dismally in another part of the world.  and i don't know what would happen if you choose to use bread flour.

here's the basic french bread that works for me.

the following are a few hints that will help you cook the best hardboiled eggs:

the fresher the egg, the harder it will be to peal it. you should purchase your eggs 2 weeks before you'll be cooking them in order to get them to peal easy.

and, the way to get the yolk to be in the center of the egg after it's boiled, is to store them on their side. this relieves the pressure on the membrane within the egg that holds it suspended.

the green coloring on the outside of the yolk is caused by cooking them too long. cooking by the directions below will eliminate that.
