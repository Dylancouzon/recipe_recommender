# Recipe Recommender

The Recipe Recommender is an intelligent, semantic-based recipe recommendation system built using Python, OpenAI, and LangChain. This project leverages natural language processing (NLP) and machine learning.

## Features
- **Semantic Understanding**: Uses advanced language models to interpret user queries and preferences.
- **Personalized Recommendations**: Suggests recipes tailored to individual tastes and dietary needs.
- **Ingredient Matching**: Recommends recipes based on available ingredients in the user's kitchen.

## Technologies Used
- **Python**: Core programming language for the project.
- **OpenAI**: Utilized for natural language understanding and semantic processing.
- **LangChain**: Framework for building applications powered by language models.
- **Chroma**: Used as the vector database for semantic search and retrieval.
- **Pandas**: For data manipulation and analysis.
- **Jupyter Notebooks**: For data exploration and prototyping.
- **Arize Phoenix**: Used for monitoring and troubleshooting machine learning models.
